    "# üè† Smart Home Automation CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìò Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In a modern smart home environment, users often want to automate various devices based on specific conditions and triggers. These automations may involve different device types (lights, thermostats, door locks), triggers (time-based, motion-based, or location-based), and conditional logic (e.g., only if someone is home, only when it's raining, or when eco mode is on).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, implementing every possible combination of triggers, devices, actions, and conditions using separate hardcoded classes quickly leads to a **Cartesian explosion**‚Äîa situation where the number of classes grows exponentially as new options are added, making the system difficult to maintain, scale, or extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Design and implement a **CLI-based Smart Home Automation System** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **design patterns** like **Strategy** and **Composition** to avoid the pitfalls of Cartesian explosion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support for different types of **triggers**:\n",
    "  - Time-based\n",
    "  - Motion-based\n",
    "  - Location-based\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support for different types of **devices**:\n",
    "  - Light\n",
    "  - Thermostat\n",
    "  - Door Lock\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support for various **actions** per device:\n",
    "  - Turn on/off lights\n",
    "  - Set thermostat temperature\n",
    "  - Lock/unlock doors\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support for optional **conditions**:\n",
    "  - User is at home\n",
    "  - Weather is not rainy\n",
    "  - Eco mode is active\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow users to:\n",
    "  - Define new automation rules via CLI\n",
    "  - List all defined rules\n",
    "  - Manually evaluate and run all rules from CLI\n",
    "  - See detailed logs of why an action was or wasn‚Äôt executed\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Tech Concepts Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OOP Principles** (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)\n",
    "- **Strategy Pattern** for Triggers and Conditions\n",
    "- **Composition over Inheritance** to build flexible rules\n",
    "- Simple CLI for rule management and testing\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This CLI app serves as a clean example of how to build complex automation systems using scalable and maintainable design techniques in Python.\n"
